 Server Composition:
    - CPU
    - RAM

    - Storage Data
    - Database: Store Data In A Structured Way

    - Network: Routers,Switch, DNS Servers

IT Terminology:
Network:
A network is a collection of devices (such as computers, servers, routers, switches, and other networking hardware) that
are connected to share data and resources. Networks can be:

- Local Area Networks (LANs): Used within a small area like an office or home.
- Wide Area Networks (WANs): Spans a large geographical area, such as the internet.

How It Works:
 - Devices communicate using protocols like TCP/IP.
 - Data is broken into small packets and transmitted through wired (Ethernet cables, fiber optics) or wireless
   (Wi-Fi, cellular) connections.
 - These packets travel through various devices like routers and switches to reach their destination.

Router:
A router is a networking device that connects different networks and directs data packets to their destination, usually
between your local network and the internet.

How It Works:

 - When you send a request (e.g., opening a website), the router examines the IP address of the destination.
 - It determines the best path for sending the data through the internet using routing tables and protocols like BGP
   (Border Gateway Protocol).
 - The router sends packets to the next-hop device (another router or the destination server).
 - When the server responds, the data travels back through routers to reach your device.

Key Features:
- Assigns local IP addresses to devices in your home or office (via DHCP).
- Uses NAT (Network Address Translation) to manage multiple devices sharing one public IP.
- Provides firewall security to filter traffic.

Switch:
A switch is a networking device that connects multiple devices in a local network (LAN) and directs data packets to the
correct destination within that network.

How It Works:

 - When a device (e.g., computer) sends data, the switch examines the MAC address (physical address) in the packet.
 - It looks up the MAC address in its switching table to find the correct port where the destination device is connected.
 - The switch forwards the packet only to the intended device, unlike a hub, which broadcasts data to all devices.

Key Features:
- Works at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) of the OSI model.
- Improves network efficiency by reducing collision domains.
- Can be managed or unmanaged (managed switches allow advanced configurations).

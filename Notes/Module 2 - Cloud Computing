What is cloud computing:
- On demand delivery of compute power , database storage, applications and other IT resource
- Pay-as-you-go pricing.
- Right type and size of computing resources.
- Access to as many resources you need, almost instantly.

- AWS owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services.

Example: Netflix,   build on aws!

Deployment models of the cloud:

Private cloud: Cloud services used by a single org, not exposed to the public, complete control, security for sensitive
applications, meets specific business needs.

Public Cloud: Cloud resources owned and operated by a third partly cloud service provider delivered over the internet
Example: AWS, google cloud , azure

Characteristics:
- On demand self service
- Broad network access
- Multi-tenancy and resource pooling
- Rapid elasticity and scalability.
- Measured service.

Advantages:
- Pay on demand , dont own hardware
- Reduced total cost of ownership
- Benefits from massive economies of scale, prices reduced as aws is more efficient due to large scale.
- Increase speed and agility.
- Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers.
- Go global in minutes , leverage the AWS global infrastructure.

Problem solved:
- Flexible: Change resource type when needed.
- Cost Effective: Pay as  you go.
- Scalability: Accommodate larger loads by making hardware stronger.
- Elasticity: Ability to scale out and scale-in when needed.
- High availability and fault tolerance
- Agility: Rapidly develop , test and launch software applications.

Hybrid Cloud: Keeps some services on premises and extend some copabilities to the cloud , so that can control sensitive
assets in your private infrastructure.

Types Of Cloud Computing:
( Resource: Notes/IaaS_PaaS_SaaS.png )

1) Infrastructure as a Service ( IaaS )
    - Provide building blocks for cloud IT
    - Provides networking, computers, data storage space.
    - Highest level of flexibility.
    - Easy parallel with traditional on premises IT

2.) Platform as a Service ( PaaS )
    - Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure
    - Focus on the deployment and management of your application.

3.) Software as a Service ( SaaS )
    - Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider.

PRICING:

AWS has 3 fundamentals , following the pay-as-you-go pricing model:
1.) Compute: Pay for your compute time.
2.) Storage: Pay for data stored in the cloud.
3.) Data transfer OUT of the cloud ( data transfer IN is free )

        Solves the expensive issue of traditional IT.
